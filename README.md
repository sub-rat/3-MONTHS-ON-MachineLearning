Learning Machine learning each 2 hours a day for a 3 months 

# Month1
## Week 1: 
Watched the linear algebra session of 3Blue1Brown.
[link of  video to learn linear regression](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=1) <br>
Here explained is done in graphical way which makes good understanding of Linear Algebra, vectors , basis vectors, Composition Matrix for transformation , rotation ,shearing etc , Matrix multiplication, dot product, cross product, Eigen value and Eigen vector.

Started learning basis of calculus. [Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m2MIpDrF7Es&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&index=5)
* Watched the video of basis of calculus ie. derivative and integration . 
*  How the circle, square or cube area is derived using the derivative. 
*  learned about the derivation of how velocity actually works with derivative rule. 
* learned about role of the tangent in any kind of curve of graph.

* watched session [Essence of calculus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qb40J4N1fa4&list=PLZHQObOWTQDMsr9K-rj53DwVRMYO3t5Yr&index=6)
* learned about Eulers number. 
* learned about Implicit differentation
